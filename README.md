## About
InsuranceProject-master is an insurance management application template containing code, configuration, and resources for policy management, claims processing, customer management, and reporting. Use this README as the primary onboarding document for developers, integrators, and maintainers.

## Features
- Policy lifecycle management (create, update, cancel)
- Claims intake and status tracking
- Customer profile management
- Basic reporting and audit trails
- Authentication & authorization (update based on implementation)
- Docker support (if present)

## Repository language composition
Update this section with the actual language breakdown shown in GitHub (e.g., Java 70%, JavaScript 20%, SQL 10%). If you don't have that breakdown, run a language stats check in the repository and paste the results here.

Example:
- Java: 65%
- JavaScript: 25%
- SQL: 10%

## Tech stack (example)
Replace or expand to match the repository:
- Backend: Spring Boot (Java) or Express (Node.js)
- Frontend: React / Angular / Vue (if present)
- Database: PostgreSQL / MySQL / MongoDB
- Build tools: Maven / Gradle / npm / yarn
- Containerization: Docker, docker-compose
- CI: GitHub Actions (or other CI provider)

## Prerequisites
Install these locally before running the project:
- Git
- Java JDK 8+ or 11+ (if Java backend)
- Maven or Gradle (if Java)
- Node.js 14+ and npm/yarn (if frontend or Node backend)
- Docker & Docker Compose (optional, if docker files exist)
- Database server (Postgres/MySQL) or Docker running DB container

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/MGChaitra/InsuranceProject-master.git
cd InsuranceProject-master
```

2. Install dependencies (examples — change to fit your project):

- Java (Maven)
```bash
mvn clean install
```

- Java (Gradle)
```bash
./gradlew build
```

- Node (frontend/backend)
```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

## Configuration
- Copy environment example files and set values:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# or
cp config/application.example.yml config/application.yml
```
- Edit `.env` or configuration files with DB credentials, ports, secret keys, and other environment-specific values.

- Database migrations (if used — Flyway / Liquibase):
```bash
# Example for Flyway (run from project root)
mvn flyway:migrate
```
or run migration containers through docker-compose if configured.

## Running the project

- Java (Spring Boot):
```bash
mvn spring-boot:run
# or
java -jar target/your-app.jar
```

- Node (backend/frontend):
```bash
npm start
# or
yarn start
```

- Docker Compose (if docker-compose.yml exists):
```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

Access application at http://localhost:8080 (or configured port).

## Running tests
- Java (Maven):
```bash
mvn test
```
- Java (Gradle):
```bash
./gradlew test
```
- Node:
```bash
npm test
# or
yarn test
```

Add or update unit/integration tests as features are added.
